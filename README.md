Hello,

I'm Tom Hayton, a former engineer turned web developer.

I'm interested in working with full-stack technologies to build interesting web apps that challenge me and leave me with a sense of accomplishment for having worked on them.

I'm currently looking to solidify my knowledge with the MERN stack, enabling me to do more with the stack that I love to use.
